# ARTlogger-PCB
This is the PCB design of the ARTlogger, a data logging device for the ART16 racecar.

This is the PCB design for the ARTlogger project, a project that was developed in order to produce a data-logger for racing purpose, during my time in Aristotle Racing Team (ART), the Formula Student team of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

This datalogger was used in the ART16, the 5th race car produced by the team.

The PCB was designed using KiCAD, an open source PCB design tool.
